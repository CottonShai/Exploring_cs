  <h2>Post 1.</h2>
    <p>I'm Cotton, also known as Virtstalker, and one half of the duo known as INDIGO TECH.
  </p>
    
   <p> I'm currently trying to get signed to a label, but have had no success. If any of ny'all are part of a label/collective, and can help, I'd really
    appreciate it.<p>

  <h3>Post 2</h3>
  <p>I'm thinking about trying to make a cassette or some sort of physical release for my music.
   
   I'm going to try to make 2 posts a day, but if I fall silent for less than a week I'm probably ok.
   
   If you want to talk to me, hmu on soundcloud pms. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/insideinsideinside">My soundcloud</a>

  <h4>Post 3</h4>
  
  <p>I wish I could get signed to +100 or dream catalogue. they have such nice communities and i look up to all of them.
   
   Bclr hasnt responded to my demos, HVRF hasn't either, and virtual dream plaza also hasnt.
   
   I wish I were good enough to get on a label so I could at least get off the ground. nobody's even gonna read this anyway tho.
